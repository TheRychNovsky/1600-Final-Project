## **Part 3: RAM**
Basics of RAM: RAM or random access memory is essentially your computer's form of ultra fast, quick access storage. Anything that your CPU is actively using and or pulling information from or storing information temporarily gets stored in your RAM rather than your SSD or hard drive. This is because RAM is exceptionally faster than any other form of storage, however, it does come with a catch. If your computer were to lose power, everything inside of your RAM would be instantly deleted; this is because RAM is a volatile form of storage in which it needs electricity to function and be able to store and transfer information.
