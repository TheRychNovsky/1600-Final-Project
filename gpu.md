## **Part 8: GPU**
Basics of GPU: GPU’s are very similar to CPU’s, as both are processors and designed to make millions of calculations at lightning fast speeds. However, the way in which they make those calculations is where the differences lie. Think of it as CPU’s being able to do 100 different kinds of math problems all at the same time at fast speeds, GPU’s do only 1 type of math problem, but at 10x the CPU’s speed. 
<br/><br/>Below is a link explaining GPU’s, and how they are related to CPU’s.
