## **Part 7: PSU**
Basics of PSU: It’s pretty straightforward what a power supply does, but if you are a complete novice I will go into basic detail. The power outlets in your home are main AC current, however all of your smaller electrical devices can’t use AC current, this is where a PSU comes in. It converts the AC to low voltage regulated DC power that can then be used by the main/necessary components in your PC. So it goes pretty much without saying that your PSU needs to be of the highest quality, and needs to be able to supply enough power to your components without overheating or going beyond their rated wattage, which would be very bad for you. There are several websites out there that let you input in every component inside your PC, so you can get an idea what size PSU you should buy. 
<br/><br/>Below I have linked two interesting videos showing the engineering and manufacturing processes behind creating PSU’s, since I don’t think a video explaining them is necessary.
