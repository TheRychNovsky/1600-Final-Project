## **Part 1: Case**
Basics of a Case: While it is important to pick a case that you think looks nice, it is far more important to pick a case that allows for good airflow. I will touch on this more when we talk about cooling and case fans, but essentially the better airflow your case has the cooler your components will be, which will allow them to perform better and last longer. Also just in general better airflow means the less your fans have to work and the quieter they will be.
