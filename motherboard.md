## **Part 2: Motherboard**
Basics of a Motherboard: In a very basic sense you can think of your motherboard as the glue that holds all of your different components together. It serves as the link for everything else in your PC and allows all of the different parts to communicate and work with each other. And as easy and simple as that explanation may be, a motherboard is actually very complex in how it does its job.  Below I have linked a video that covers all of the main parts of a motherboard, without getting too technical or complex.
