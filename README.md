# Learning About PC Hardware
### A Tutorial by Adam Allee
The purpose of this tutorial is to educate anyone who is interested in what actually makes up a PC, as well as how a PC works in general. It will cover every piece of hardware that is required for a PC to function, and even includes several videos at the end of the tutorial covering, step by step, complete builds of different PCâ€™s so viewers can see exactly how everything fits together after learning about all the hardware. 
<br/>All of the explanations and content used is very much beginner friendly, as this tutorial is directed at the people who are not yet very experienced when it comes to computers. With that being said, the target audience can really be any adult or young adult(teenager) who is newer to computers and or technology in general, or who wants to learn more about how computers work. Even someone who has been using a computer, cell phone, or tablet for a long time still stands to learn a lot from this tutorial.
