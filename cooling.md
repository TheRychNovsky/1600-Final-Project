## **Part 6: CPU Cooler and Case Fans**
Basics of Cooling: Cooling the components of your PC is one of the single most important things to consider with any build. Computers work entirely upon the use of electricity, which generates heat, lots of heat. The more powerful components you have, the more power they will use and the more heat will be generated that needs to be removed and or cooled. Case fans are integral to ensure cool air is constantly being pulled into your case, and the hot air is being exhausted out. As for cooling the CPU the two most common methods are with heat pipes and fins paired with fans, or pre-built closed liquid coolers. While both perform perfectly fine with almost all consumer CPU’s, the more powerful/higher end CPU’s need liquid cooling to be able to perform a peak performance. 
<br/>Below I have linked two videos explaining how CPU coolers work, both air and AIO (or liquid) coolers.
